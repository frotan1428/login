<!-- Styling HTML with CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using an external CSS file -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a Blue Heading</h1>

</body>

</html>
