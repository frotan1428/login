<!-- HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>

        <p>
        This paragraph
        contains a lot of lines
        in the source code,
        but the browser 
        ignores it.
        </p>

        <p>
        This paragraph
        contains      a lot of spaces
        in the source     code,
        but the    browser 
        ignores it.
        </p>

        <p>
        The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
